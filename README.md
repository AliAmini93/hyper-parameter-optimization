# ADHDeepNet Hyper-parameter Optimization
I used many ways to optimize the hyper-parameters of the EEGNet model for detecting ADHD and controlling people. This repository contains hyper-parameter tuning methods such as Bayesian optimization, the Gaussian process, and Grid search. The Keras-tuner and Scikit-optimize packages are used to accomplish the Bayesian optimization. Cross-validation using the Keras-tuner library is not readily achievable. As a result, I used the Scikit-optimize package with the functions BayesSearchCV and gp minimize, which are implemented with the corresponding names of Bayesian optimization and Gaussian process.   Since it is difficult to pass a validation set that is not in the cross-validation folds in BayesSearchCV or GridSearchCV, the Gaussian process code is the best for having a distinct validation set and customizing the training process.
